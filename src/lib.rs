//! This crate is small and nearly dependency-less crate that implements a simple aggregating
//! event-loop and a cheap actor implementation with a global actor-pool.
//!
//! ## Why should I use this crate?
//! You probably shouldn't. There are other solutions like [actix](https://crates.io/crates/actix)
//! out there that are much mor complete, much better tested and probably much more efficient.
//!
//! But if you want to avoid the [dependeny hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) or
//! if you want to understand the crates your'e using, this crate _could_ suite you ðŸ˜‡
